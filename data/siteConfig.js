  authorDescription: `My goal as a software developer is to create high-quality products that are widely understood. I want to help others to better control and organize data. Through this work, I want to build relationships in the digital and non-digital world that lead to new possibilities. 
  
 For the last 10 years, I've been working in non-profits in a coordinator role as a planner, administrator and teacher. The signature of my work has been competency, consistency and quality. With these principles in mind, I look forward to working as part of a team to continue to grow products and programs.`,
